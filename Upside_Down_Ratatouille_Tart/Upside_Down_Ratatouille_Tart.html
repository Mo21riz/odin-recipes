            <h2>things needed</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to drizzle</li>
                <li>3 medium onions (450 g), sliced thinly</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
                <li>1 fresh long red chilli, sliced</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
                <li>4 small roma tomatoes (240 g), halved lengthways</li>
                <li>1 large zucchini (150 g), cut into 1 ½ cm thick rounds</li>
                <li>1 medium eggplant (300 g), cut into 1 ½ cm thick rounds</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>1 ½ sheets frozen puff pastry</li>
                <li>½ cup firmly packed fresh basil leaves</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, chilli and thyme. Reduce heat to low; <br>
                    cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes or until onions are soft and caramelised.</li>

                <li>Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F. Line an oven tray with baking paper.</li>

                <li>Place tomatoes, zucchini and eggplant on lined tray, drizzle with vinegar <br>
                    and remaining oil; season. Bake for 20 minutes or until vegetables are browned. Remove from oven and increase oven temp to 220°C/425°F.</li>

                <li>Line a 20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 in) slice pan with baking paper,<br>
                     extending the paper 2 cm (¾ in) over sides. Thaw pastry then join sheets together to form a long rectangle.</li>

                <li>Place tomatoes, cut-side down, <br>
                    on base of lined pan with zucchini and eggplant to fit snuggly, side by side.<br>
                     Top with caramelised onion and half the basil leaves.</li>

                <li>Place pastry over the vegetables and trim if necessary, leaving enough to tuck in around the inside edges of the pan.</li>

                <li>Bake tart for 25 minutes or until pastry is puffed and golden. Leave in the pan to cool for 5 minutes.</li>

                <li>Place a board or platter large enough to cover the pan over the tart; flip tart onto board, then remove the lining paper.</li>

                <li>Drizzle tart with extra olive oil and top with remaining basil.<br>
                     Cut tart into four wedges, and eat soon after baking, while the pastry is still crisp and warm!</li>
            </ol>
